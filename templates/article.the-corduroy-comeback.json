Once a symbol of workwear utility and collegiate nonchalance, the ribbed textile is finding new purpose in modern menswear, transformed by refined tailoring, innovative finishes, and a fresh design perspective. Today’s corduroy isn’t about nostalgia — it’s about contrast, character, and confidence.",

By the 1970s, it had become a countercultural uniform — rugged, rebellious, and richly tactile.</p><p>Fast forward to now: designers are recasting corduroy in lighter, more luxurious iterations. No longer stiff or heavy, it’s being spun from finer cottons and blended fibres to create garments that drape like wool and feel like velvet — a sartorial shift that has placed corduroy back in the fashion spotlight.</p>",

        "text": "Corduroy’s appeal lies in its texture — a subtle but striking element that lends depth to everything from suits to overshirts. Where traditional suiting often leans sleek and flat, corduroy adds visual intrigue and tactile richness. A peak-lapel corduroy blazer or a cuffed trouser with side tabs speaks not just to detail, but to modern sophistication.Its adaptability is another draw. Modern corduroy is far lighter and softer than past versions, making it seasonally agile. It holds warmth through the cooler months without feeling bulky — ideal for layering or as a standalone statement. In rich greens, sand tones, and deep navy, corduroy invites tonal dressing with nuance and dimension.",
